# Baby_Monitoring
the proposed methodology for baby sleep/awake detection utilizes a combination of Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) analysis and pose estimation techniques. The system first attempts to detect the eyes and determine the EAR to classify the baby's sleep/awake status. In cases where the eyes are not visible, the system employs pose estimation and movement analysis as an alternative method for sleep/awake detection.

# How to Run
